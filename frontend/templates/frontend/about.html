            My name is Charles Thompson and Iâ€™m terribly sorry if youâ€™re tired of seeing this name or my <a
                href="//twitter.com/cpkthompson">not so hilarious tweets</a>. I only promise you more of each.
            <br>
            <br>
            Okay okay so myself? Iâ€™m a junior developer, and what that means to me is: I play a lot with beginner code and havenâ€™t really done anything substantial. Iâ€™ve done a few projects
            <a href="//github.com/cpkthompson">here and there</a> , but you know, theyâ€™re all playground stuff.
            <br>
            <br>
            Iâ€™m also a design enthusiast and I only started saying this to look cool but eventually trapped myself into actually liking design. Design means a lot to different people so Iâ€™ll clarify the particular type Iâ€™m interested in later (if â€˜laterâ€™ wasnâ€™t a hyperlink then ask me on Twitter)
            <br>
            <br>
            I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accra">Accra, Ghana</a>. A developing West African Nation about to take on the world. I attended <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">University of Ghana</a> for my parents and <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">Sikkim Manipal University</a> - DE for myself. LOL etcetera etcetera.
            <br>
            <br>
            Iâ€™m very interested in systems, processes and the meta details of how things become what they are. Also the biggest science and technology aficionado alive with an even more honest way of saying it being: Iâ€™m addicted to technology and donâ€™t think staring at screens 24/7 is a bad thing. That said, youâ€™ll be surprised to know Black Mirror (and Game of Thrones ðŸ˜‰) are my all time favorite TV shows and Iâ€™m open to <a href="https://twitter.com/cpkthompson">discussion</a> about them any time of the day!
