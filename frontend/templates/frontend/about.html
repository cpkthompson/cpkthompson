                My name is Charles Thompson and Iâ€™m terribly sorry if youâ€™re tired of seeing this name or my <a target="_blank"
                    href="//twitter.com/cpkthompson">not so hilarious tweets</a>. I only promise you more of each.
                <br>
                <br>
                Okay okay so myself? Iâ€™m a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer, and what that means to me is: I play a lot with beginner code
                and havenâ€™t really done anything substantial. Iâ€™ve done a few projects
                <a target="_blank" href="//github.com/cpkthompson">here and there</a> , but you know, theyâ€™re all playground stuff.
                <br>
                <br>
                Iâ€™m also a design enthusiast and I only started saying this to look cool but eventually trapped myself into
                actually liking design. Design means a lot to different people so Iâ€™ll clarify the particular type Iâ€™m
                interested in later.
                <br>
                <br>
                I live in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accra">Accra, Ghana</a>. A developing West African Nation
                about to take on the world. I attended <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">University of Ghana</a> for my
                parents and <a target="_blank" href="https://smude.edu.in">Sikkim Manipal University - DE</a> for myself. LOL etcetera
                etcetera.
                <br>
                <br>
                Iâ€™m very interested in systems, processes and the meta details of how things become what they are. Also the
                biggest science and technology aficionado alive with an even more honest way of saying it being: Iâ€™m
                addicted to technology and donâ€™t think staring at screens 24/7 is a bad thing. That said, youâ€™ll be
                surprised to know Black Mirror (and Game of Thrones ðŸ˜‰) are my all time favorite TV shows and Iâ€™m open to <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://twitter.com/cpkthompson">discussion</a> about them any time of the day!
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Find me</h3>
                I limit myself to 140 characters <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cpkthompson">over here</a>, upload nice selfies for the love of my life F to see
                <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/cpkthompson">over here</a> and do emails via <a href="mailto:charles@cpkthompson.com?Subject=Hello%20Again!" target="_top">charles@cpkthompson.com</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                Okay, alright, that's enough for an introduction right? I'll fake it up later when I really want to get a job somewhere or something but until then, I guess the this has been fun.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cheers,
                <br>
                Charles Thompson.
