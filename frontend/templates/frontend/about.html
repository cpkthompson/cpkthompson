                Hi! ðŸ‘‹

                <br>
                My name is Charles Thompson and Iâ€™m terribly sorry if youâ€™re tired of seeing this name or my <a target="_blank"
                    href="//twitter.com/cpkthompson">not so hilarious tweets</a>. I only promise you more of each.
                <br>
                <br>
                Okay, okay so myself? Iâ€™m a Junior Web Developer, and what that means to me is: I play a lot with beginner code and do a lot of web development <a href="">"things"</a> but in all, havenâ€™t really done anything substantial. Iâ€™ve done a few projects
                <a target="_blank" href="//github.com/cpkthompson">here and there</a> , but you know, theyâ€™re all playground stuff.
                <br>
                <br>
                Iâ€™m also a design enthusiast and I only started saying this to look cool but eventually trapped myself into
                actually liking design. Design means a lot to different people so Iâ€™ll clarify the particular type Iâ€™m
                interested in later.
                <br>
                <br>
                I live in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accra">Accra, Ghana</a>. A developing West African Nation
                about to take on the world. I attended <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">University of Ghana</a> for my
                parents and <a target="_blank" href="https://smude.edu.in">Sikkim Manipal University - DE</a> for myself. LOL etcetera
                etcetera.
                <br>
                <br>
                Iâ€™m very interested in systems, processes and the meta details of how things become what they are (borrowed this sentence from
                <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/equartey">someone</a> who accurately said what I've been trying to say, so I <i>borrowed</i>). I'm also the
                biggest science and technology aficionado alive with an even more honest way of saying it being: Iâ€™m
                addicted to technology and donâ€™t think staring at screens 24/7 is a bad thing. That said, youâ€™ll be
                surprised to know <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Black Mirror</a> (and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Game of Thrones</a> ðŸ˜‰) are my all time favorite TV shows and Iâ€™m open to <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://twitter.com/cpkthompson">discussion</a> about them any time of the day! Oh, I almost forgot, there's nothing I love more than an episode of
                <a target="_blank" href="http://hellointernet.fm">Hello Internet</a>. Yes, I'm a Tim :)
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Find me</h3>
                I limit myself to 140 characters <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cpkthompson">over here</a>, upload nice selfies for the love of my life to see
                <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/cpkthompson">here</a> and do emails via <a href="mailto:charles@cpkthompson.com?Subject=Hello%20Again!" target="_top">thompsoncharles@live.com</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                Okay, alright, that's enough for an introduction, right? I'll fake it up later when I really want to get a job somewhere or something but until then, I guess this has been fun.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cheers,
                <br>
                Charles Thompson.
